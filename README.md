# SC_PasswordGenerator
In this project, I created a password generator.  

When user pressed the button, they were asked 5 different sets of criteria for their password. 

Depending on their answers, it generates a password with at east 1 char from their selected set(s). It chooses the rest from selected sets randomly.
